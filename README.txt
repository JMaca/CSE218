Data Structures and Algorithms Final Exam

Short Answer :
1. 	A recursive algorithm has advantages such as it will call itself until the purpose is done rather than having to manually
 	call a method multiple times. It reduces the lines of code required for a purpose and is easy to read.
 	A disadvantage of recursion is it is not always the fastest way to do do a purpose.

2. 	Avg. case Big O
1. 	Binary Search - O(log n)
2. 	Sequential Search - O(n)
3. 	Bubble Sort - O(n^2)
4. 	Insertion Sort - O(n^2)
5. 	Selection Sort - O(n^2)
6. 	Quick Sort - O(n log n)
7. 	Merge Sort - O(n log n)
8. 	Heap Sort - O(n log n)

3.
	Stacks have a last in, first out behavior.
	Queues have a first in, first out behavior. 
	Priority Queues have a custom order based on priorities. 

4. 
	Arrays are great for random access as they can go right to specific element,
	but they require a predetermined amount of space to create and are slow for search , insert and deletion. 

	Linked List are great when you don't know the amount of data you will need to store.
	and they keep insertion order. LinkedList are quick for insertion and deletion but are slow for search.

	Binary Search Trees are excellent for most cases as insert, delete, search are O(log n) but
	they do not keep insertion order and they do not allow duplicates. 

	Hashed data structures are great for search , insertion and deletion with constant time O(1),
	but are based on array and should have a predetermined amount of space.
	They do not keep insertion order and they do not allow duplicates.

5. 	Data structure classes in the API are coded using interfaces because it hides all of the details 
   	and let the user create their own use for them with clean looking code.
