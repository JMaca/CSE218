  This project was to create a custom text editor with user interface . I provided basic login and sign up pages and all functions for the menu bar. I wrote the markov generator which read through a document and counted the frequency of words that came after specific words. It put those words into a list and created a new document based off of possible words that would come after the specific words. This helped me learn more about data structures and when to use HashMap/HashTree or TreeMap/TreeSet. This code runs but there are some redundancies which need to be addressed.
